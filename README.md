## Features

Here’s an overview of what the platform supports :

- Multi-vendor marketplace: vendors can register, authenticate, and manage their own product catalog.  
- Vendor dashboards: product CRUD, order management, sales analytics.  
- Customer browsing & ordering: search, filters, product pages, cart, checkout.  
- Admin panel: oversee vendors, orders, site settings, commissions, disputes.  
- Payment integrations (e.g. via gateways)  
- Email notifications: registration, order updates, vendor alerts.  
- Localization / multilingual support   
- Responsive UI  
- API endpoints   
- Testing (unit, feature)

## Requirements & Dependencies

These are the main system requirements and dependencies you need:

- PHP ≥ *[version]*  
- Composer  
- A web server (Apache, Nginx) or PHP built-in server  
- MySQL / MariaDB (or your choice of supported DB)  
- Node.js + npm (for front-end build tools, assets)  
- Laravel framework (specify version)  
- Other packages (see `composer.json`)  
- Docker & Docker Compose  

---

## Installation & Setup

Below are steps to get the project running locally.

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PHPDEV-OPS/MartF.git
   cd MartF
``

2. **Install PHP dependencies**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node / frontend dependencies & build assets**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev   # or `npm run prod` for production build
   ```

4. **Copy and configure `.env`**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Generate app key**

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Configure your database credentials in `.env`**

7. **Run migrations and seeders**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed       # optional, if you have seeders
   ```

8. **Storage link (if needed)**

   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   ```

9. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

At this point, you should be able to access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever host/port your server is configured to use).

---

## Installation & Setup

You may need to configure the following in `.env` or appropriate config files:

* `APP_URL`
* Database settings: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
* Mail settings (SMTP host, port, username, password, etc)
* Payment gateway credentials (if using Stripe, PayPal, etc)
* Vendor commission rates, fees
* Storage (local, S3, etc)
* Any third-party integrations (e.g. SMS, push notifications)

You might also want to include configuration options in `config/` files (e.g. `config/marketplace.php`) for such settings.

---

## Usage

### Vendor Flow

1. Vendor registers / signs up.
2. Vendor logs in, gets access to vendor dashboard.
3. Vendor adds / edits / deletes products (name, description, price, images).
4. Vendor views orders placed for their products, updates order status.
5. Vendor receives notifications about new orders, cancellations, etc.

### Customer Flow

1. Browses the marketplace, applies filters, searches.
2. Views product details, vendor information.
3. Adds items to cart, proceeds to checkout.
4. Completes payment, receives order confirmation.
5. Views order history, tracks orders.

### Admin Flow

1. Admin logs into admin panel.
2. Reviews vendor applications, approves or rejects vendors.
3. Manages all orders across vendors, see summaries or by vendor.
4. Sets global settings: commission rules, site configuration, payment gateways.
5. Handles disputes or vendor-customer issues.

---

## Database & Migrations

* All migrations reside under `database/migrations`.
* The schema includes tables such as: `users`, `vendors`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `vendor_payouts`, `commissions`, etc.
* Use `php artisan migrate` to set up the schema.
* If you modify schema, create new migrations to ensure versioning.

---

## Seeding & Demo Data

If you include seeders, you can populate initial demo data (vendors, sample products, categories) using:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

You can create custom seeders (in `database/seeders`) to generate dummy vendors, products, etc.

---

## API / Endpoints

If your project exposes an API (e.g. REST endpoints), document the available routes, request/response formats, authentication method (token / JWT / passport / sanctum), and sample requests.

Here’s a sample structure you might use :

| HTTP Method | URI                   | Description         |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| GET         | /api/products         | List all products   |
| POST        | /api/vendors/register | Vendor registration |
| POST        | /api/orders           | Place an order      |
| ....        | …                     | …                   |

Be sure to document required headers (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) and error codes.

---

## Tests

If your project includes tests (in `tests/`):

* Run the tests with:

  ```bash
  php artisan test
  ```
* Or using PHPUnit:

  ```bash
  vendor/bin/phpunit
  ```
* Write unit tests and feature tests for critical parts: vendor registration, order placement, commission logic, etc.

---

## Docker / Containerization

If you have Docker support (via `docker-compose.yml`), you can provide instructions like:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app bash
# inside container:
composer install
npm install && npm run dev
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Describe which services are included (e.g. `app`, `db`, `redis`, etc) and how ports are mapped.

---

## Environment Variables

Here’s a minimal set of `.env` variables you’ll likely need (expand as required):

```
APP_NAME=MartF
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=martf
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

MAIL_PORT=
MAIL_USERNAME=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=

PAYMENT_GATEWAY_KEY=
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SECRET=
COMMISSION_RATE=0.10

FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=public
```

Be sure not to commit `.env` with secrets; use `.env.example` for placeholders.
